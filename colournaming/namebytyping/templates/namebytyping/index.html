         This test will take approximately 5 minutes. You will be shown a
         series of images, each of which has an area circled. Your task is to
         name the colour in that circle. Try to be as descriptive as possible,
         for example saying “lavender” instead of “purple” or “dark orange”
         instead of “orange”. If you are able to read this, then your computer has the ability to use voice recognition to let you answer the questions (barring problems with the microphone or computer itself). Before the test starts there are three
         profile questions to answer. All data collected on this website is completely anonymous. Are you currently able to use and comfortable with using speech recognition to answer these questions?
