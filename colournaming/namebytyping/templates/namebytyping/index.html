         This test will run for approximately 5 minutes. You will be shown a
         series of images, each of which has an area circled. Your task is to
         name the colour in that circle. Try to be as descriptive as possible,
         for example saying “lavender” instead of “purple” or “dark orange”
         instead of “orange”. If your browser is Google Chrome or Firefox you
         <strong>may</strong> (we will notify you if you can) be able to use
         your computer's microphone to name the colours by speaking them rather
         than having to type them. Before the test starts there are three
         questions to answer. All of your data is completely anonymous and no
         voice data from speech recognition is ever recorded - only the words
         that the computer thinks you said - nor is it possible for voice
         recognition to be switched on without your express permission. Granting
         permission to use voice recognition on this website will <b><i>not</i></b>
         grant permission to any other site.
