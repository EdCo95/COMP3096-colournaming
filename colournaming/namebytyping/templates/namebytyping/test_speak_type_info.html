      <p>
         You have been allocated the <strong><i>Speaking and Typing Test</i></strong>.
         In this test, you may either speak the name of the colour in the circle,
         or type the name in the textbox. Your computer will automatically listen
         for speech, once you have given it permission to use the microphone.
         If you decide to type a colour name, simply press enter to submit the answer.
         If you speak the name, then the answer will submit automatically. <br><br>

         Remember to speak clearly, but <strong><i>do not worry if
         the computer doesn't understand you correctly</i></strong>, for example it
         may think you said "dog" when you actually said "dark". If this happens,
         ignore it. Wrong interpretations are still valuable data about the
         experiment's accuracy!

         <br><br>If you cannot see the circle, there is a button underneath the image
         which you can click to skip the image. Finally, after 60 seconds with
         no answer, the speech recognition will turn off. If this happens, type
         the name of the colour for the image you're currently on, and as soon as
         you press enter and move to the next image, the speech recognition will
         restart. If the speech recognition is not working at all - i.e. 10 seconds
         after you say something no words have appeared in the textbox - then
         simply type the answers and ignore the speech recognition.
